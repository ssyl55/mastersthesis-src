Spring 2020

This repository contains code I wrote to do some calculations in my master's thesis. If you are coming from my thesis,
welcome! Note that at present my code is ill-commented and function names are short and not informative. I am hoping to
document my code more clearly sometime in the future (or better yet, port it to SageMath!).
