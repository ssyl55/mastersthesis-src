# mastersthesis-src

Spring 2020

This repository contains code I wrote to do some calculations in my master's thesis. If you are coming from my thesis,
welcome! Note that at present my code is ill-commented and function names are short and not informative. I am hoping to
document my code more clearly sometime in the future (or better yet, port it to SageMath!).

## Steps to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your machine.
2. Open Matlab and in the console navigate to the src/ directory.
3. In the console, run `run secondorder.m`
